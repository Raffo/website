		<h4>Interests:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Computers in a very broad meaning. There is really a lot I like doing and learning.</li>
			<li>Cloud Native technologies. I'm a Kubernetes contributor even though I don't really like some parts of it.</li>
			<li>Code and delivery quality, which means CI/CD and a lot more.</li>
			<li>Programming languages: Go (my main focus right now), Java (which I am forgetting) and I wish to learn Rust.</li>
			<li>Neapolitan Pizza, but really all pizza is great (as long as it doesn't have pineapple on top).</li>
			<li>Wine, mostly Italian, but I'm open to try new things.</li>
		</ul>
